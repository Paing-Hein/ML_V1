sample1. Download 50 images for each of three different categories with some possible confusions.
e.g. pineapple, jackfruit and durian
       different kinds of mangoes
       celebrities with similar race and face
       human, humanoid robot, cyborg
But the examples are shown just for you to have an idea of the categories. You can work on any categorical topics or labels you like. 
Attached, code for batch downloading and conversion of file type has been given.

2. Resize the images to reasonable size (e.g. 50 by 50 pixels). You will get three matrices presenting R,G, and B colors in the image. You may take features for full color or the mean values and standard deviations as you deem appropriate.

3. Prepare the dataset, i.e., the feature matrix and the target. The target may be labelled as you desire, e.g. 0 for pineapple, 1 for jackfruit and 2 for durian. 

4. Split the data into training and test dataset. For this, you may use sklearn module. 

5. Train the model on the training dataset using OnevsAll algorithm and report the training accuracy and the confusion matrix. 

6. Predict the classes using the test dataset and report the test accuracy and the confusion matrix. 

7. Comment on your finding by discussing the effect of feature normalization, hyperparameter tuning (i.e., adjusting the learning rate and the regularization parameter) on the accuracy of the model.

You can submit either Jupyter notebook or Python script.
